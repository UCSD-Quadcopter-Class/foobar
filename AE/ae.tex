\section{Artifact Appendix}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}

This appendix provides the necessary information for obtaining the source code,
building, and running performance and functionality tests of Corundum. 
We describe the hardware and software requirements to run the
experiments and reproduce the results as they appear in the \refsec{sec:results}.

\subsection{Artifact check-list (meta-information)}

{\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Program: } Corundum library and its unit tests, Rust, Cargo, PMDK v1.8. Input files for the experiments are included (74~MB).
  \item {\bf Compilation: } Rust 1.50.0-nightly (publicly available), GNU C++11, CMake $>=$ 3.3 
  \item {\bf Data set: } Data set is included (\verb+eval/inputs+)
  \item {\bf Run-time environment: } Linux (latest version). The NVMM should be mounted in \verb+/mnt/pmem+ using a DAX-enabled file system (e.g. EXT4-DAX). We also provide a docker image containing linux 20.04 LTE with pre-installed dependencies.
  \item {\bf Hardware: } A machine with a 16-core Intel processor with 16 GB or larger NVMM (e.g. Optane DC). The docker does not require NVMM and uses DRAM to emulate NVMM. 
  \item {\bf Metrics: } Execution time
  \item {\bf Output: } Numerical results stored in \verb+perf.csv+ and \verb+scale.csv+ for performance and scalability, respectively. Expected results are also included in the text.
  \item {\bf Experiments: } A script is provided to run the experiments and generate results. Although the results may vary depending on the build and the environment, there should not be a big difference between Corundum's performance and PMDK's.
  \item {\bf How much disk space required (approximately)?: } 32~GB
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to prepare workflow (approximately)?: } 30 minutes
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to complete experiments (approximately)?: } $\leq$ 1 hour.
  \item {\bf Publicly available?: } Code, unit-tests, documentation, examples, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.
  \item {\bf Code licenses (if publicly available)?: } Apache v2.0
  \item {\bf Archived (provide DOI)?: } \href{https://zenodo.org/record/4329841}{DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4329841}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Description}

\subsubsection{How to access}

The artifacts are publicly available
through Zenodo archival repository and GitHub. You can access the code by using its \href{https://zenodo.org/record/4321062}{DOI} or cloning the GitHub repository at \href{https://github.com/NVSL/Corundum/}{https://github.com/NVSL/Corundum/}.

We also prepared a Docker image available 

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}

We recommend running the experiments on a machine with physical persistent memory such as Intel Obtane DC with at least 16~GB available space.

Also, the scalability tests require at least 16-core processor to measure the execution time while running threads in parallel.

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If you wish to use Docker, please install Docker and use the prepared docker image with pre-installed dependencies. Otherwise, please run \verb+eval/setup.sh+ on Ubuntu latest version.
  \item To measure performance, we use \verb+perf+, a linux builtin monitoring tool for analyzing programs (included in \verb+eval/setup.sh+).
  \item To compare Corundum with PMKD, please install both `libpmemobj' and `libpmemobj-cpp' by running \verb+eval/build.sh+.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}

The docker image already have the dependencies pre-installed. If you wish to run it on a real system, please follow the steps in the rest of this section.

\subsubsection{Installing Rust}

If you prefer installing Rust manually rather than running `\verb+setup.sh+', please follow throw these steps.
On a Unix-like OS machine, the following commands
install Rust compiler, Cargo, and \verb+rustup+. 

\begin{verbatim}
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \
     -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup default nightly
\end{verbatim}

If tou are using
another OS, please refer to Rust's official website
for the instructions at
\begin{center}
  \verb+https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install+
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Building Corundum}

Corundum is publicly available in GitHub. Please use
the following commands to clone and compile it.

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone https://github.com/NVSL/Corundum.git
$ cd Corundum
$ cargo build --release --examples
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Verifying the compilation}

Optionally you can run the tests to verify it.
Since tests may share pool files, we run them sequentially
by using a single thread.

\begin{verbatim}
cargo test --tests -- --test-threads=1 
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experiment workflow}

Running the experiments is automated though the following set of commands (for your convenience, please login as `root').

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone https://github.com/NVSL/Corundum.git
$ cd Corundum/eval
$ ./setup.sh     # Install dependencies
$ ./build.sh     # Build the workloads
$ ./run.sh       # Run the tests
$ ./results.sh   # Display the results
\end{verbatim}

The \verb+eval/setup.sh+ downloads necessary libraries (for PMDK and Rust), and \verb+eval/build.sh+ compiles the benchmark applications.
\verb+eval/run.sh+ executes benchmarks and collects the results, and generates two files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+perf.csv+: Compares Corundum with PMDK (Figure 1)
  \item \verb+scale.csv+: Evaluates multi-threading scalability (Figure 2)
\end{itemize}

\noindent Finally, \verb+eval/results.sh+ displays the results on screen.


\subsection{Running on a Docker}

We also prepared a docker image with pre-installed dependencies, PMDK (libpmemobj and libpmemobj-cpp), Corundum, and the input datasets. We will use \verb+tmpfs+ in the docker to mount DRAM into `\verb+/mnt/pmem0+'. We also need to enable \verb+perf_event_open+ system calls. Please run the following commands on the host machine to give permission to, download, and run the docker image.


\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVSL/\
Corundum/main/eval/docker-default.json
$ docker run --security-opt \
    seccomp=./docker-default.json \
    --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/mnt/pmem0 \
    -it mhz88/corundum:latest bin/bash
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Inside the docker, please run the following commands to run the experiments.

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ~/Corundum/eval
$ ./run.sh && ./results.sh
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Evaluation and expected results}

We discuss performance evaluation in terms of execution time compared with an equivalent implementation in PMDK, and execution time using multiple threads to show scalability. 

\subsubsection{Performance}

To compare Corundum's performance with PMDK, we use three applications written in both of them: BST, VKStore, and B+Tree. The provided script runs these applications automatically with random inputs. The results are stored in \verb+perf.csv+ and should look like \reftab{tbl:perf}.

\begin{table}
  \center
  \small
  \setlength\tabcolsep{1.5pt}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{Execution Time (s)}	\\ \hline						
    & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{BST}	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{KVStore}&\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{B+Tree}	\\ \hline	
    & INS&CHK&PUT&GET&INS&CHK&REM&RAND\\ \hline
    PMDK&4.5&4.1&8.7&5.1&8.6&2.2&7.9&6.3\\\hline
    Corundum&3.4&3.4&2.9&2.1&12.9&1.4&11.8&8.6\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Expected output for performance comparison between PMDK and Corundum (perf.csv).}
  \label{tbl:perf}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Scalability}
To verify that Corundum provides scalability with respect to the thread number, we implemented a MapReduce application called \verb+grep+ which counts the frequency of every word in a list of text documents. The producer threads fill up a shared stack, and the consumer threads pop a batch from the stack, using a local record, count the frequency of every words in the batch, and finally update a shared HashMap with the local records. \reftab{tbl:scale} shows the expected execution times in seconds for various number of producer (p) and consumer (c) threads. We use Large Canterbury Corpus (http://www.data-compression.info/Corpora/CanterburyCorpus/) dataset as the input files (included in the archive).

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \center
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    p/c&1&2&3&7&14\\ \hline
    1&30.83&15.85&11.09&7.45&8.03\\ \hline
    2&28.77&15.65&11.65&6.96&7.36\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Expected output for Scalability (scale.csv) using emulated PM.}
  \label{tbl:scale}
\end{table}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experiment customization}

Corundum requires a DAX-enabled file system. We recommend EXT4-DAX. If you run the experiments on a real machine, use the following commands to format and mount the derive.

\begin{verbatim}
mkfs.ext4 /dev/pmem0
mount -o dax /dev/pmem0 /mnt/pmem0
\end{verbatim}

Many of the latency components are originated in Hardware, such as using \verb+CL_FLUSHOPT+ instead of \verb+CL_FLUSH+ when available. Corundum does not automatically detect these capabilities. However, it comes with some builtin features. In `\verb+Cargo.toml+', under the `features' section, update \verb+default=[]+ as required. For example, if the system supports \verb+CLWB+ instructions, you may force Corundum to use that by changing the default features to this:

\begin{center}
  \verb+default = ["pthread", "use_clwb"]+
\end{center}

Please note that in \verb+run.sh+, we disabled \verb+CL_FLUSHOPT+ and \verb+CLWB+ to force both PMDK and Corundum use \verb+CL_FLUSH+ to persist data.
