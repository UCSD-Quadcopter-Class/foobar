\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

\This{} enforces PM safety invariants using mostly static checks.  It,
therefore, eliminates memory management, pointers safety, and logging bugs and
avoids the attendant costs of testing, debugging, fixing, and recovering from
them.  It accomplishes this using Rust's type system to carefully control when
the program can modify persistent and volatile state and when and where mutable
references to persistent state can exist.  Our experience shows that \this{}
relatively easy to use and our measurements show that \this{}'s performance is
as good as or better than PMDK.
